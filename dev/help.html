    <h1>Fitch Web</h1>
    <p>
      Fitch Web is a web-based proof notating and verifying program for writing
      natural deduction proofs in propositional logic.
    </p>

    <h2>How to Use</h2>
    <p>
      Below an example of a proof of ⊢(((A ∧ B) → C) ↔ (A → (B → C))) is
      provided as a guide for syntax. See below for a table of operators (WIP).
    </p>
    <pre>
|_
| |_(A&B)->C
| | |_A
| | | |_B
| | | | A
| | | | A&B
| | | | (A&B)->C
| | | | C
| | | B->C
| | A->(B->C)
| |_(A->(B->C))
| | |_A&B
| | | A
| | | A->(B->C)
| | | B->C
| | | B
| | | C
| | (A&B)->C
| ((A&B)->C)<->(A->(B->C))

    </pre>
    <p>(Note that your proof <u>must</u> end in a newline.)</p>
    <p>
      Notice that after putting the example into the input box (including the
      newline at the end), a (slightly) formatted version of the proof will
      appear to the right or below of the input box.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the right of this proof will also be a column of text inputs. These
      inputs are used to verify the proof; each input being a justification of
      its corresponding proof line.
    </p>
    <p>
      A justification is made up of a rule, then some lines that fulfill the
      requirements of the rule. The justifications for the example are provided
      below, starting with an Assumption corresponding to the empty assumption
      at the top.
